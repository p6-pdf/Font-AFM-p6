   Release 1.21

   Perl 6 port of Perl 5 version 1.20. See https://metacpan.org/pod/Font::AFM for previous
   change-log and other details.

   Build
   - included full set of AFM data in etc/Core14_Fonts
   - font metrics are computed at panda build time

   Font::AFM
   - stringwidth now works on all codepoints, not just latin-1 subset. Perl 6 strings are
     fully unicode aware, Yay!
   - factored out @ISOLatin1Encoding table. Replace with dependency on Font::Encoding

   Font::Metrics
   - classess are now lowercase, e.g. Font::Mertics::times-bold. Plays better with upstream
     case insensitive handling, e.g. in PDF::Compose
